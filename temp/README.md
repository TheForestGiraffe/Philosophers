# 42 Core — Philosophers (WIP)

This repository contains my implementation of the **Philosophers** (Dining Philosophers) project — a classic concurrency and multithreading problem.  
The goal of this exercise is to deepen understanding of threads, synchronization, and resource management in C.

> **Status:** Work in progress

---

## 📘Project Overview

The Dining Philosophers problem is a well-known concurrency challenge where a group of philosophers alternately think and eat, sharing limited resources (forks) without causing deadlocks or starvation.

This project is part of the **42 Core** curriculum and focuses on:

- POSIX threads (`pthread`)
- Mutexes and synchronization
- Thread safety and race condition avoidance
- Timing and controlled execution
- Clean C program architecture

---

## What This Project Teaches

By implementing this project, I am practicing:

✔ Concurrent multithreading  
✔ Controlled access to shared resources  
✔ Deadlock prevention strategies  
✔ Monitoring and terminating routines  
✔ Careful use of timing functions in C  

These skills are directly applicable to real-world systems programming.

## Learning Path

This project complements my work in:

- push_swap
- minishell
- Exam preparation

and strengthens my skills in concurrent systems programming.

## Notes

- Developed and tested on Linux  
- Compiled using `gcc`  
- Follows 42 coding standards  
- Project structure and features will evolve
